      "Agent: **Luster** is the way light interacts with the surface of a mineral, rock, or any other material, and how it is reflected. It's essentially a description of how shiny or brilliant a material appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's one of the primary physical properties used by geologists and mineralogists to identify minerals, but it applies to many other materials as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What Luster Describes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Reflectivity:** How much light is reflected from the surface.\n",
      "2.  **Quality of Reflection:** Whether the reflection is sharp and mirror-like (specular) or scattered and diffuse (dull).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Factors Influencing Luster:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Surface Roughness:** A perfectly smooth surface will produce a sharper, more mirror-like reflection (higher luster). A rough or fractured surface will scatter light, making it appear duller.\n",
      "*   **Refractive Index:** For transparent or translucent materials, a higher refractive index can contribute to a more brilliant luster because light is bent more significantly as it enters and exits the material.\n",
      "*   **Internal Absorption:** How much light is absorbed by the material versus reflected.\n",
      "*   **Chemical Composition and Structure:** The atomic structure and bonding within a material determine how light interacts with its electrons, affecting reflectivity. For example, the free electrons in metals are highly effective at reflecting light.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Types of Luster (with examples):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Luster is broadly divided into two main categories: **Metallic** and **Non-Metallic**.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Metallic Luster:**\n",
      "    *   Materials with metallic luster look like polished metal. They are typically opaque, highly reflective, and have a high degree of brilliance. Light doesn't penetrate the surface much; it bounces off.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** Gold, silver, pyrite, galena, polished steel.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Non-Metallic Luster:**\n",
      "    *   This category covers a wide range of appearances that do not resemble polished metal. Light generally penetrates the surface to some extent.\n",
      "    *   **Sub-types of Non-Metallic Luster:**\n",
      "        *   **Vitreous (Glassy):** Looks like glass. It's typically transparent to translucent and reflects light brightly.\n",
      "            *   *Examples:* Quartz, calcite, feldspar, broken glass.\n",
      "        *   **Adamantine:** The brightest non-metallic luster, resembling a cut diamond. It's characterized by extremely high brilliance due to a very high refractive index.\n",
      "            *   *Examples:* Diamond, zircon, rutile.\n",
      "        *   **Resinous:** Looks like hardened tree sap or plastic. Often has a waxy or slightly oily sheen.\n",
      "            *   *Examples:* Amber, sphalerite.\n",
      "        *   **Pearly:** Iridescent, soft, and glowing, resembling a pearl or the inside of a seashell. Often seen in minerals with a layered or platy structure.\n",
      "            *   *Examples:* Muscovite (mica), talc, gypsum, natural pearls.\n",
      "        *   **Silky:** Resembles silk threads. This luster is characteristic of fibrous minerals.\n",
      "            *   *Examples:* Asbestos, fibrous gypsum, malachite (fibrous variety).\n",
      "        *   **Greasy:** Appears to be coated with a thin layer of oil or grease. Often found in minerals with many microscopic inclusions or a somewhat uneven surface.\n",
      "            *   *Examples:* Nepheline, some varieties of quartz, talc.\n",
      "        *   **Dull / Earthy:** No shine whatsoever, completely lacking in reflection. Resembles dry earth or unglazed porcelain.\n",
      "            *   *Examples:* Kaolinite, unglazed pottery, bauxite, many soil minerals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Importance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Luster is a crucial property for mineral identification in the field because it's often consistent for a given mineral and can be easily observed without special equipment.\n",
